    Commands  are  first  read from /etc/zshenv; this cannot be overridden.

    Commands are then read from $ZDOTDIR/.zshenv.  
    If the shell is a login shell, commands are read from /etc/zprofile and then 
    $ZDOTDIR/.zprofile.
    
        Then, if the shell is interactive, commands are read from /etc/zshrc and then $ZDOTDIR/.zshrc. Finally,
    if the shell is a login shell, /etc/zlogin and $ZDOTDIR/.zlogin are
    read.
