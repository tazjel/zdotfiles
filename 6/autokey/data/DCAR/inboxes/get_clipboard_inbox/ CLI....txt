Student Comments
9/15/10 - 10/14/10

-I have learned more than I had expected to learn. I now have better skills for making better choices in how I have managed money in the past. I hope to avoid problems in the future when it comes to managing our money to better our lives and hopefully purchase another home in the future. I am also hoping to be less stressed about how and when to put our money to better use, and hope that we can overcome this financial setback and come out of this situation with a positive attitude towards being better money managers..Thank you.
-I absolutely believe this is the very best and most accessible course on line.
-I found the information in this course to be helpful. This is the first time I have felt as though I can take the information and apply it to my own situation. I especially like the goal cards.
-The course was extremely informative and covered more than I would have imagined. Truly time well spent and I will continue to use as a resource for information, Thank you
-Thank you. Before I started this course I thought it might be boring and time wasted but soon realized I needed this information a long time ago. I am excited to use this new knowledge; actually I have started using it, in my everyday life. Everyone should have this info! Thank you again.
-This credit counseling course was educational and enlightening to the point where I now comprehend much more about the world of budgeting and goal setting. 
-We will be changing our lives for the better! I want to be able to teach my kids how to do it right! The schools really need to start teaching kids about budgeting in grade school. Maybe they could teach their parents how to budget! Thank you!
-This course was well thought out with very useful information. I'm glad that the Federal Trade Commission was mentioned. There is a lot of great information for consumers on their website.
-I really enjoyed this online class. It was well presented and very informative. It didn't waste time with worthless, preachy repetition, but was quick and to the point. I have bookmarked this site to return and review. There are several people (family and friends) that I would like to share this class with. Thank you.
-I was very impressed with the content of this course. It has given me an entirely different attitude about the importance of a budget and that it is never too late to start.
-I found this course to give me significant facts and directions to make changes in how I can be responsible for my money. The ownership of my choices is very significant and I understand the importance of what I did not know or do from an internal perspective. I grasp the importance of Goals and Budgeting and plan to make them active parts of my life. To have access to this material is very much appreciated. 
-As a 20 year (previous) homeowner, able to make good money and relatively smart person, I thought I could not learn much from this program. However, I did learn about credit and the laws and the importance of goal setting. Thank you. I thought it was worthwhile to take this course.
-Even though I sat at my computer for some hours I was very much interested in this course. It was in layman’s terms and very understandable. I am more concerned with budgeting, especially with this economy. Thank you very much. Also the representatives on the phone are very kind and compassionate.
 -This course was well worth my money. I was never really taught a lot about budgeting until now. Budgeting should be taught in grade school. This course did well teaching me how to handle my finances better. I will recommend this course to others. Thanks Money in Motion.
-Although I was familiar with a great deal of the information, there were several new laws that I learned. This course should be standard in all high schools and colleges as required learning. Something that should be used, especially for younger people, is a separate savings for loss of job and/or insurance. I have learned this the hard way.
-Thank you, this was an excellent course despite my post-divorce bankruptcy results. The course materials were informative and helped reinforce some already established principles. 
-I found this course very helpful and the people I spoke with on the phone very polite and knowledgeable. I would recommend this course to others with financial concerns or if they just want help in setting goals and budgets. Thank you.
-Thank you for helping me to understand about life and money. I feel with God and myself I can make the right choices. I will turn it around with the knowledge that you have given me. Thank you again.
-The course was simple & easy to understand. I believe something of a very similar nature should be taught to our children in our schools today, as many of them are not taught these things at home & are clueless in the real world once they are on their own. Thank you! 
-I thought this program was very helpful. Quite honestly before I took the program I was not expecting to gain that much from it but I did. I would like to see a little more about investment or retirement, since people don't tend to think about the money they will live off of when they are older I think these things would be helpful.
-This course is so helpful. I wish I'd known about this years ago!! I'm passing this book on to my children!! And giving some of the valuable info to co-workers.  Is this taught in schools and colleges? It should be!! And on every job! I'm thankful for this class, but so sorry I had to receive this way. The teacher was so helpful and encouraging.
-I feel that I have learned a great deal from this course. I have never used a budget, keeping the income and expenses in my head, leading to late payments and problems. I resolve to keep a budget, and put small amounts into savings each month to increase as time goes by.
-I thoroughly enjoyed the information and the fabulous amount of helpful and meaningful budgeting, investing, and saving information, along with the consumer alertness considerations, and where to go if there were questions beyond what could easily be seen. 
-I found the course very helpful with how to create and stick to a budget. I have made budgets in the past but couldn't stick to it due to unforeseen circumstances that arose. This course helped me by showing me how to put money for such circumstances in a savings account and to allow for such circumstances when creating a budget. Thank you very much.
-The course is well thought out and informative without being condescending to the participant. It would make a fine course to be taught to high school and college students as finance and the workings of the finance system are not well understood. I believe that the information provided will make the rebuilding process for my family much clearer and successful. Thank you.
-I wish I had a course like this many years ago. It would have been a life saver and I may not have been filing bankruptcy now. This course was an eye opener. It has given me the directions I need to take to make sure my finance are handled well in the future. If I had listened to my late father, I would have known all this since he lived his life by it. He never paid interest and never had a debt he could not repay in his life. 
-This online course was helpful and convenient as I am a cancer victim and have been confined to hospital or my own bed for over two months. Most of the information I already knew and have practiced for many years. However, I did find it very informative and it helped me remember things I knew but never really practiced. For example, it has inspired me to get specific and write down my goals and carry this info with me in my wallet!
-There were some topics discussed that I have learned through life experiences, but many topics were clear and simple to understand in real life situations. The information presented was well researched and written in language that any individual would be able to comprehend and use in everyday life. Thank you so much. What a blessing and a God send this program has been to our family.
-I found the course very helpful. I've printed the chapters and made a binder/notebook to refer back to the materials often. I am very excited and grateful for this course and can't wait to start over (financially) with a clean slate.
-Excellent level of writing for average adult understanding Good examples for understanding Government acts a must! So many people do not know this....including me! Helped me with things I did not know or did know and simply did not realize the importance of use on a regular, on-going basis. 
-This was a very enlighten program that caught my attention at the mistakes I made in the past. I ask that this program be taught to everyone especially to the youth starting out in the work world to show how it will greatly help and enhance their future. Thank you.
-I was really amazed at this course and I learned a great deal which I find very useful! This course gave me valuable information on keeping a good budget and setting goals! I feel this course should be a mandatory part of a high school education!
-Thank You Very Much! The Information Thru This Online Course Was Helpful Opened My Eyes Up Even More To Do Better & Make The Right Decision As I Move Forward Getting Back On Track.
-These programs should be part of a requirement for making large purchases such as cars or homes. Had I taken this program prior to purchasing my home, I would not have purchased it. 
-This is a wonderful program. Teacher has been and I know she will continue to be of great help to those she is in contact with. This means at work, home and any one she comes in contact with. She has truly been a Blessing to us. Whatever you pay her is definitely not enough! THANK YOU! 
-I really enjoyed doing this. This program gave me ideas that I would have never thought of doing. Also, it gave me the information that I can use to get my life back in order. This was a great program.
-the course was very helpful and every chapter in this course had something in it that I will take with me the rest of my life and I will be very responsible from here on out and will use this information the rest of my life
-I really enjoyed reading this material. This course was very informative for me, as well as, based on present circumstances related. I wish I had received this advice before making my current financial and past errors. Thanks for the opportunity to take this class. 
-The course was truly an eye-opener and very helpful. I will use the information I received to help me get on the right path to rebuilding my credit. I will be back to visit the website to review more information as I start to build my credit back. 
-I want to thank everyone who contributed to this book of information for us to learn from and to apply and to pass down to my kids and whoever else I could help.
-This course reaffirmed some things that I already knew and gave me the tools to put that knowledge to use.
-This was very helpful to me and helped me see where I can make improvements and do things I wasn't doing that would help me in the future
- I looked at many (over 120) competing website before I decided to choose yours. Your website is very user friendly and informative. I am very impressed that you took time to call me personally to discuss the course, and that you were interested in my feedback. I wish you continued success in your business and personal life. Thank you!
-I truly learned from the material and live course. It was very encouraging to know I can finally get back on track to financial freedom.
-Superb. I learned more in 120 minutes, about finances, than in the past 30 years. Thank you!
-I know this class is very informative, will help many people. My wife and I are disabled and doing this class in this way helped very much. Teacher's help has helped us more than we can say! We both live our lives being honest, going to church, helping our neighbors and family as much as we can, they do the same for us. This help is never spending money only time, thoughts and prayers. Thank you, you are a special person to us! Thank you all.
-The information provided in these courses was extremely helpful to me in my situation. I will be sure to abide by the instructions given to the best of my ability. Thank you.
-Most information I understood previously. However, I would like to see a money management course to be included in the general education at school or high school level. To have this information on financial literacy would prevent a lot of households getting in trouble before it happens. I particularly like the idea of promoting a budget adherence based on your personal financial goals to enhance the continuance of both.
-I greatly appreciate the opportunity to take this course on-line. Bankruptcy was the least expected thing in my life, severe, unexpected and actually rare illness made life quite difficult. The future will be spartan, but livable.
-I have check marked kids and money. My children are ages 17-26. I would really like some advice about sharing money ideas to help them. They will see the benefits of my husband and me taking steps, but I am concerned that it will take us a longer period of time than we want at their ages.
-Believe me, I thought I wouldn't get much from this course, but I was pleasantly surprised. Some parts I had no interest in them, but quite helpful to learn if I came across them again. Other helpful hints, like setting goals, but start off with small goals first then go to your ultimate goal, making a budget with savings on the top of the list. You may find this pathetic, but I really didn't know what to do with a savings or a budget for this matter. I will try and learn these skills, once I get employed.
- Some people are in difficult credit situations due to circumstances beyond their control and are well aware of a majority of the content in this class. However, the rebuilding your credit information is very useful for anyone trying to get back on track. Also, the information on the different laws that have been passed regarding credit issues is very helpful.
Excellent course!
-Great course.... I enjoyed and learned a lot from it... thanks a lot and more power...
-I thank teacher, for he patiently answered each and every one's questions even with an echo in the background at times due to someone's phone.
