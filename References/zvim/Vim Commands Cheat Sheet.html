Substituting


  
    :[range]s[ubstitute]/{pattern}/{string}/[c][e][g][p][r][i][I] [count]
    For each line in [range] replace a match of {pattern} with
    {string}.

    Repeat last :substitute with same search pattern and substitute string, but without the same flags.  You may add extra flags
  


The arguments that you can use for the substitute commands:
[c]  Confirm each substitution.  Vim positions the cursor on the matching
  string.  You can type:
      'y'      to substitute this match
      'n'      to skip this match
         to skip this match
      'a'      to substitute this and all remaining matches {not in Vi}
      'q'      to quit substituting {not in Vi}
      CTRL-E  to scroll the screen up {not in Vi}
      CTRL-Y  to scroll the screen down {not in Vi}.
[e]     When the search pattern fails, do not issue an error message and, in
  particular, continue in maps as if no error occurred.  
[g]  Replace all occurrences in the line.  Without this argument,
  replacement occurs only for the first occurrence in each line.
[i]  Ignore case for the pattern.  
[I]  Don't ignore case for the pattern.  
[p]  Print the line containing the last substitute.


Copying and Moving Text

sequence of other non-blank characters, separated with white space (spaces,
tabs, ).  This can be changed with the 'iskeyword' option.
A WORD consists of a sequence of non-blank characters, separated with white
space.  An empty line is also considered to be a word and a WORD.

    Search forward for the [count]'th latest used pattern
  
  
    //{offset}&lt;CR&gt;
    Search forward for the [count]'th latest used pattern with new.  If {offset} is empty no offset is used.
  
  
    ?{pattern}[?]&lt;CR&gt;
    Search backward for the [count]'th previous occurrence of {pattern}
    
  
  
    ?{pattern}?{offset}&lt;CR&gt;
    Search backward for the [count]'th previous occurrence of {pattern} and go {offset} lines up or down 
  
  
    ?&lt;CR&gt;
    Search backward for the [count]'th latest used pattern 
  
  
    ??{offset}&lt;CR&gt;
    Search backward for the [count]'th latest used pattern with new {offset}.  If {offset} is empty no offset is used.

    Repeat the latest "/" or "?" [count] times.
  
  
    N
    Repeat the latest "/" or "?" [count] times in opposite direction.
    
  

Selecting Text (Visual Mode)

To select text, enter visual mode with one of the commands below, and use
motion commands to highlight the text you are interested
in.  Then, use some command on the text. 

The operators that can be used are:
  ~  switch case
  d  delete
  c  change
  y  yank
  >  SHIft right 
  <  shift left 
  !  filter through external command 
  =  filter through 'equalprg' option command 
  gq  format lines to 'textwidth' length 



  
    v
    start Visual mode per character.
  
  
    V
    start Visual mode linewise.
  
  
    &lt;Esc&gt;
    exit Visual mode without making any changes
  

How to Suspend


  
    CTRL-Z
    Suspend Vim, like ":stop".  Works in Normal and in Visual mode.  In Insert and Command-line mode, the CTRL-Z is inserted as a normal character.
  
  
    :sus[pend][!]  or :st[op][!]
    Suspend Vim.  If the '!' is not given and 'autowrite' is set, every buffer with changes and a file name is written out.  If the '!' is given or 'autowrite' is not set, changed buffers are not written, don't forget to bring Vim back to the foreground later!
