      C
      change from current cursor position to the end-of-line


      cw
      change from current cursor position to the end of the word


      J
      joins the next line to the current line (inserts a space between the two)


      gJ
      joins the next line to the current line (without a space)


      :12,24j
      join lines 12 thru 24, leaving a space between each line.


      ~
      switch lower and upper cases


      r
      replace the current character with the next character typed


      4rx
       replace next four characters with "x"


      R
      overwrite until &lt;esc&gt;


      s
      substitute the current character and go into insert mode.
        Same as "rxi &lt;ESC&gt;"


      S
      substitute the current line, erase it, and go into insert
        mode, starting at the indentation of the line. Same as "cc"


      >>
      shift current line forward


      3>>
      shift three lines forward


      >%
      shift all lines until a matching brace or parenthesis


      >}
      shift to the end of the paragraph


      >'m
      shift to the marked line


      &lt;&lt;
      shift current line backward

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;a
          href=&quot;1-1.sh&quot;&gt;1.1 Accessing Substrings&lt;/a&gt;


      :'x,.s:^\([^ ]\+\) \(.*\):&lt;\1&gt;\1 \2&lt;\/\1&gt;&lt;br&gt;:

        Colons are used here instead of the usual slashes for separating the 'find' and 'replace' parts. The part ^\([^ ]\+\) finds all of the characters up to the first space and saves them for use in the 'replace' part as \1.


      :'x,.s/^/#/

        the line marked with mx to the current line
