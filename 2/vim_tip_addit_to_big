Welcome to my Vim Page.  Herein you'll find a number of scripts, some source
code (needs compiling, but I do have pre-compiled executables for you PC
types), and Vim syntax files.  If you'd like to know more about Vim, check out
Vim Online.  For more about vi, click on the  vi lovers home page.  The
syntax files below are often snapshots of my working copies, so sometimes they
may be works-in-progress.  Usually such files will say ASTRO-ONLY
somewhere in the top four lines of the file.  In any case, the scripts here
will be more up-to-date than the versions, if any, that I put on vim.sf.net.


As a word of warning: Nasa Federal Credit Union has been taking out $5/month from my daughter's savings account.  Since this account was a "kid's" account,
it tends to be inactive.  I admit that I don't look at the kids' statements every month; I generally do so once per year at tax time.  They claim that they
called my daughter, but as its a family phone with an answering machine, I can confidently say that there was no such phone call.  So, I advise you not to
set up "kid" savings accounts with NASA-FCU.


If you'd like to be on the cutting edge of Vim, may I suggest reading
Getting the Vim source with Mercurial.

Nearly all scripts herein will be using the vimball archive format (*.vba
files) which first became available with vim 7.0 -- it provides for better
installation and automatic helptag generation.  If there's a "vba" suffix,
you'll need vim 7.0 or later!  Vim 7.0 users, however, do need to get a new
version of (vimball);
vim 7.1 users already have a sufficiently up-to-date version of vimball.

Layout:
This admittedly long page is organized into the following format: Contents,
Subpages, and Links.  Subpages, which cover specific topics, are separated by
horizontal lines and have links to the Contents and Links at their bottom
right.  A few subpages also provide links to more complete webpages (ex. "Color Scheme").
Typically subpages will also provide a link to "Links" in or near
their first sentence; this Link goes near where the associated script, code,
etc is in the Links section.


Netscape Users:
(on the PC) Some versions of Netscape on the PC have this unfortunate "feature"
that causes files to be renamed which have more than one period in them (the
periods become underscores).  As a consequence, WinZip doesn't know what to do
with the downloaded file.  Just pay attention and fix up the name Netscape
gives in its saving/downloading dialog box (ie. restore the name to what it
was).  WinZip should then be able to understand what to do with the files.

"Abbreviations" for C
Normally with abbreviations one has to type a space to kick off the
abbreviation.  I wanted to put in stub-like bits of code for common C
constructs such as if, for, etc.  Well, instead of an abbreviation, I rather
like the following solution: use an inoremap on
"`"
and have it examine the previous word to decide
what to do.  If you'd like to try it out, click on Dr Chip's C Abbreviations
(also listed as Stubs).


   Shorthand  Longhand
   Map        Map
   i`                                               if`
   e`                                               else`
   ei`                                              elif`
   f`                                               for`
   w`                                               while`
   s`                                               switch`
   c`                                               case`
   d`                                               default`
                                                    do`


There are also maps for E`, R`, and D` which generate DrChip's debugger calls.

This approach allows your cinoptions to be effective, so you get the
indentation style you prefer (abbreviations prevent this).  So,
if you use my stubs file, you probably should set the cino option.  That way
the stub will be indented in your style.  I've included a copy of my cinoptions below;
feel free to incorporate them (my style is the best, of course!) and change them as
you will (aw, shucks).


set cino=>s,e0,n0,f0,{0,}4,^-1s,:0,=s,g0,h1s,p2,t0,+2,(2,)20,*30



  >s add 1 shiftwidth on normal indent

C/C++ Code Beautifier

The <ccb> program
(get ccb source here)
beautifies C and C++ code.
Be careful -- this program does change indentation and can move curly braces
around, but if it still has a bad bug, it could damage your source if you use
the -r flag (replace).  That's why
this program is labelled  Use At Your Own Risk!.
The -s flag is much safer; it saves
the beautified versions in *.cb files.  Make sure that the beautified source is
ok before doing anything irretrievable with your original source code.  That
said, it does work for me, and normally produces output close to my own
preferred style.  The "standard" cb style can be obtained with -cdfi.  Now that I've released it to the World,
expect some bug reports to crop up (hopefully no really awful ones).


ccb has been on my website since May 25, 2000 with no runtime bugs reported!

C/C++ Functions: prototypes, hints, etc.

Intro: Flist
is a program which does a number of things with C/C++ source files' functions: use it to generate
listings of functions, prototypes, calling trees, tags, and more (
get flist source here)!  You may find the maps in
flistmaps a help in using flist with the
current file in Vim.

Hints: Flist's -h option makes <hints> files.
After you've used flist to generate your hints file, just source it into
your editing session or put the following code into your
<.vimrc> for automatic sourcing of hints:


if filereadable(expand("hints"))
  au BufNewFile,BufReadPost *.c,*.C,*.cpp,*.CPP,*.cxx  so hints<CR>
endif


The result?  Every time you type a function name, a prototype for it will
appear on the information line.  In order to see it, you should set your
cmdheight to 2 or more (:set ch=2) and possibly have showmode off (:set nosmd).

<!-- Hints for Python: Kevin Dahlhausen says "Flist is great! Thanks so much... Flist motivated me -->
<!-- to write a program that creates a hints file for Python source."  You can -->
<!-- download his code for generating a -->
<!-- Python hints file. -->
<!--  -->
Maps: Along with flist itself I've
provided a small set of maps which use flist.  The maps take the form
\[px][pxgs]: prototype or extern, and prototype, extern, global, and static.
The map invokes flist against the current file and inserts a list of
(global/static/both) prototypes or extern-style function declarations.  The \pc
map inserts a list of prototypes suitable for inclusion in a comment.

Source Trees: Flist's -Tg option builds a tree-like graph of function use.
Coupled with the Flist-based Tree plugin for vim 6.0 or later,
one can browse the calling tree on the left hand side of the screen,
select a function to edit by putting the cursor on its line, and hitting
return.  Put <FlistTree.vim> into your plugin directory; you may then use the
command :Flist [filename(s)] to begin graph-tree editing.  See the
usage notes in <FlistTree.vim> for more commands!  Click for a
screenshot if you'd
like to see it first.

Dummy Functions: Flist includes a -D option, which generates "dummy" function
definitions.  In order to make trees, flist makes a pass over all the source
files to determine what functions are present, and then a second pass to
determine what functions are called by what functions.  Thus common functions
(such as printf) are ignored, and the structure of your program is usually
better revealed.  However, if you want to know where such functions are called,
or functions that were defined in your own personal library, you may wish
to set up a <dummy.c> file containing a list of such functions with no
body (or even arguments).  That way flist will process the dummy file
quickly.  The -D option allows one to generate such a dummy file easily
from real ones.


    Calling Options    Explanation
   flist    *.c                                           list functions in files

   flist -h *.c                                           generate a <hints> file
   flist -p *.c                                           list prototypes
   flist -t *.c                                           list of functions for inclusion in a comment
   flist -x *.c                                           list functions as externs
   flist -Ta *.c                                          list calling tree, all roots
   flist -Tg *.c                                          "graphical" calling tree
   flist -Tf *.c                                          functions found report
   flist -Tu *.c                                          functions used/called-by report

Color Scheme

I've included Vim-script which implements my choice for syntax
highlighting.  Please check out my page on DrChip's colorscheme
for the colorscheme I use.  I like keeping the same colorscheme for both
gui (gvim) and console (vim); the latter restricts the number of colors available, so such dual-use
colorschemes must needs be designed for the limitations of the console.

Patches


	getfsize patch
	    This patch extends getfsize({fname}) to getfsize({fname}[,unitsize]).
		The optional second argument specifies the units that getfsize()
		will return the file size in.  It's useful for handling file
		sizes that are over 2GB.

	helptags patch
		This patch extends the helptags command to construct personal help tags files
		with *.txt files in subdirectories.  Looks like Bram has already included it
		with v7.3 patch 734!

    Lua patch
	   This patch, by Luis Carvalho, provides internal vim support for Lua (akin to vim's support for perl, etc).

PC: Pre-Compiled Executables

I've included some pre-compiled executables for the PC for which I used a Borland
C/C++ compiler (under Miscellaneous in the Links).
As a bonus, I've thrown in my calculator program, too.  You should
still get the source code distributions; if you have ansi escape sequences enabled
for your MS-DOS windows, and have <rdcolor.dat>, prompts and help will come
up in color.  The copyright notices associated with the source distributions also
still apply to the executables.

Spelling Checker

The English spelling checker
(under Scripts in the Links)
uses Vim's native syntax highlighting ability to make
misspelled (English) words show up as an "Error" (usually white on a red
background).  Vim 7.0 introduced a built-in spelling checker with many
features based on those engspchk provided; however, engspchk is still
good for those of you still using earlier versions of vim.

The Vim-based English spell checker also supports entering words
that the cursor is on into a temporary or permanent dictionary and allows one
to skip to the previous or subsequent spelling error (if any).  It co-exists
quite well with TeX, LaTeX, Html, and other such specialized text, and can
be used to check the spelling inside comments in various programming languages.

Getting Started:

The English spelling checker now comes as a "tarball":
gunzip the file <engspchk.tar.gz> and
tar -oxvf engspchk.tar in the .vim or _vimfiles
directory.

The English spelling checker is a plugin; it
does a quick load and makes a map for &#092;ec (actually the &#092;
is <Leader> which can be changed; see :he mapleader).
The dictionary isn't loaded until one types &#092;ec.
It also creates a menu item to load the spelling checker for gvim
(the gui).

The custom user dictionary and optional Webster's 1913 dictionary
is stored using the path specified by the vim variable g:cvimsyn,
settable in the <.vimrc>.
If that variable isn't set, then the CVIMSYN environment
variable, if it exists, is used.

If you want to use the environment variable approach:


   sh                   CVIMSYN="path";export CVIMSYN
   csh                  setenv CVIMSYN "path"
   ksh                  export CVIMSYN="path"
   Windows 95,98        in <autoexec.bat>:
                        set CVIMSYN=..path..
   Windows 2000,NT,etc  Right click on <My Computer>
                        Choose <Properties>
                        Click <System Properties>
                        Click <Advanced> tab


Moving:
For Vim versions 5.04 and later, the <engspchk.vim>
file additionally provides two maps (\en and \ep) to move to the next and preceding
spelling error, if any.  I suggest you upgrade if you haven't already, because
Vim's functions are powerful!

Custom Dictionary:
Engspchk allows the user to temporarily save (\et) or to
permanently save (\es) words the user uses but somehow isn't in
Engspchk's dictionary.  A temporary save only affects the current
vim editing session; a permanent save writes the word to a custom user dictionary
which is automatically loaded in the future.

Alternatives:
For Vim version 6.0 and later, <engspchk.vim>
provides the (\ea) map which brings up a one-line alternatives window for the
word under the cursor.  Move left and right with the full power of Vim, and
when the cursor lies on the desired substitute word, a simple carriage return
will cause replacement.  You'll also need to have the
agrep
program to do this (there's a pre-compiled for Windows version available using
this link).  The first use of (\ea)
takes longer than subsequent use because the script that gets invoked constructs
a plain list of words from the engspchk file.

No Flashing:
With Vim version 6.0y and later and starting with version 2.04 of
engspchk no longer will Error highlighting flash on and off while you're
typing.  Thanks go to Chase Tingley (with emendations by Bram Moolenaar) who
wrote the changes to Vim to make this possible.

More Words:  Previously the
<wb1913_engspchk.vim> file was provided separately, but it is
now provided in the <engsphck.tar.gz> tarball.  still optional if you'd
rather not load it.  Webster has provided an electronic copy of the words from
its 1913 edition; those words that appear in that dictionary that don't appear
in <engspchk.vim>'s dictionary itself are provided in the
<wb1913_engsphck.vim> file.  If the file appears in the directory
specified by the g:cvimsyn variable (or by the CVIMSYN environment variable)
then it is loaded automatically.

Languages other than English: There are now variants of
<engspchk.vim> for Dutch, German, Hungarian, Polish, and Yiddish.  Engspchk
has been improved so that mostly all that's needed are the dictionaries themselves.
I'd appreciate it if you could let me know where on the Web to find it so I can make a link on
this page to it!

<!--  Dutch nlspchk.dict.bz2-->

Thomas Köhler has made his create script which
uses the Bourne shell; it merges a dictionary with engspchk.vim to
create a spelling checker for another language.

Since vim 7.0 and later now includes embedded spell checking, I've removed
most of the spelling dictionaries.  If someone is still interested, please
send me an email (NdrOchip@ScampbellPfamily.AbizM - NOSPAM) and I'll send
you a copy.  Unfortunately, I'm limited on my webspace, and I needed the
space!  I have dictionaries for Dutch, French, German, Hungarian, Italian,
Polish, Russian, and Spanish.

Tag Generation

I have written my own tag generating program (get source for hdrtag here);
although Exuberant Ctags is good, I know how to modify hdrtag
to suit me.  It contains tagging generation for C/C++, C/C++ header files,
lex, yacc, TeX (cites and labels), vim scripts (functions and syntax), and Maple V.

Exuberant Ctags will no longer be distributed with vim as of v6.0i.  I've provided
a link to its home site here.

Text Alignment

The alignment scripts (<Align.vim> and <AlignMaps.vim>) now supplant
the older external filter approach.  The new scripts, which include help and
plentiful examples, provide:

 cyclic left, right, and centering justification of fields
     cyclic or equivalent regular-expression separators
     cyclic left, right, and centering of multi-length separators
     improved initial white space control: retain, eliminate, re-use first
     specifiable separator padding
     visual range specified alignment, including via visual-block
     multiple maps in <AlignMaps.vim> which tackle complex
         alignment problems, such as aligning C/C++ declarations,
         function argument lists, etc.


See my DrChip's Alignment Tool for Vim page for links and examples.

Vim Functions, Plugs, and Stubs

 VIM 7.0 USERS: BE SURE TO GET THE LATEST VIMBALL PLUGIN BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO USE SCRIPTS UPLOADED ON OR AFTER AUG 1, 2006


Various functions, plug-ins, and quick-insertion stubs follow alphabetically.  There are several
plugins that I post both here and at vim.sf.net.
Scripts here are my most up-to-date ones and may be considered as alpha/beta releases;
I tend to put the ones I'm updating/fixing here.  After a bit of feedback, and a variable length
of time (ie. whenever I get around to it), I will also post the scripts on
vim.sf.net.

Most plugins here are provided in the vimball format; simply use vim name_of_plugin.vba.gz
and follow the directions.  Windows users may not have a gunzip utility; if you're a Windows user,
you'll need to get one if you don't have one already.

   Item  Tool/Suite  Free  Website
   7zip                                      tool                                            y                                         try here
   Winzip                                    tool                                            n                                         try here
   unxutils                                  suite                                           y                                         try here
   cygwin                                    suite                                           y                                         try here
   GnuWin32                                  suite                                           y                                         try here
   MinGW                                     suite                                           y                                         try here


Then type :so %; this runs the vimball utility and distributes the components of the plugins where they belong.  It also enables help via vim's help facility for the plugin (ex. :help netrw).

I use three release states with my plugins:

    NOT RELEASED -- my latest version (labelled v[0-9]*[a-z], ex. v3b).
				  These versions may be handed out to individuals while I'm
				  attempting to debug some problem they're having.  The version
				  number will remain fixed while the plugin is in this state.
				  These versions of my plugins shouldn't get generally
				  released, but accidents happen.
				

     ASTRO-ONLY -- a somewhat experimental version of a plugin, like
	              "NOT RELEASED" versions, also labelled with a trailing
				  letter such as v[0-9]*[a-z] (ex. v3b).  These versions
                  do have their trailing letter changed as they get
                  updated.  These versions appear on this website.
				

     (nothing) -- the plugin has been released on vim.sf.net
	              and concurrently on this website.  These versions also drop the trailing
                  letter, having the format v[0-9]* (ex. v3).  Those plugins which Bram has
				  picked up for distribution with Vim have also been forwarded to Bram.
				


Thus v1a is ASTRO-ONLY or possibly NOT RELEASED; v3 is RELEASED.

In other words, I use the ASTRO-ONLY stage as an alpha/beta release, and NOT
RELEASED as an alpha.  This process is supposed to help get the bugs out before
the plugin is potentially released to thousands.

If you have some feedback (problems or kudos!), please send an email to NdrOchip@ScampbellPfamily.AbizM
(remove the embedded NOSPAM therein first, of course).


  After/Syntax Directories <!-- {{{2 -->
          Updated Apr 07, 2005 (v2a)           <!-- vbafiles/aftersyntax.vba.gz -->
		                                          (this plugin is superceded by vim 7.x, which looks into after/syntax subdirectories on its own)
                                                  Several directories, such as .vim/after/syntax, allows multiple files
                                                  therein but vim does not look into sudirectories therein.  By copying this
                                                  file to such a directory, and renaming it using the subdirectory name + ".vim",
                                                  the subdirectory name will be scanned for any and all *.vim files and such
                                                  files will be loaded.
                                                  Also available at vim.sf.net where you may rank it.


     DrChip's Astronaut Colorscheme <!-- {{{2 -->
         Updated Apr 01, 2013 (v8f)           <!-- vbafiles/astronaut.vba.gz -->
		 IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT VIM AND GVIM USING THE SAME COLORS, THIS COLORSCHEME IS NOT FOR YOU!!!  (guess I'm tired of those who complain about the use of only 8 colors...)

		 This colorscheme is a dark-background style colorscheme with the
		 advantage that it works with console/terminal vim in the same way that
		 it works with GUI vim.  Thus it is restricted to using just the basic
		 eight colors that many xterms are limited to.  The <astronaut.vim>
		 file gives you the dark background colorscheme I prefer and use.  If
		 you'd like to see a preview, check this out, and see check out DrChip's colorscheme.

     Alignment  <!-- {{{2 -->
         Updated Apr 16, 2013 (v38)          <!-- vbafiles/Align.vba.gz -->
		 Manual
                                                 Aligns text based on patterns (see this page for more!).  The vimball for this plugin contains both Align and AlignMaps;
												 the latter is for most users' convenience.  If you're one who wishes not to have AlignMaps, the :AlignMapsClean command will remove the
												 AlignMaps plugin from your installation.
                                                 NOTICE: The latest version of Align and AlignMaps given here need vim 7.0aa.
                                                 Also available at vim.sf.net where you may rank it.


     Alignment Maps  <!-- {{{2 -->
         Updated Jun 10, 2011 (v42m)          <!-- vbafiles/AlignMaps.vba.gz -->
		 Manual
                                                 Provides numerous maps to facilitate text alignment (see page for more!)
                                                 Also available at vim.sf.net where you may rank it.


     Ansi Highlighting  <!-- {{{2 -->
         Updated Dec 06, 2012 (v13d)          <!-- vbafiles/AnsiEsc.vba.gz -->
		 Manual
												  This plugin follows Ansi-escape sequences to colorize subsequent text using vim's syntax highlighting engine.
												
												  The AnsiEsc plugin provides a single command:  :AnsiEsc ,
												  which will toggle Ansi-escape sequence processing.
												  When enabled, AnsiEsc will handle <esc>[FGm,
												  <esc>[ATTR;FGm, and <esc>[FG;BGm sequences;
												  subsequent text will then be colored appropriately.
												
												  With vim 7.2 and earlier, the escape sequence itself will take space but will be suppressed using "Ignore" highlighting.
												  Vim 7.3 comes with Vince Negri's conceal/ownsyntax capabilities built-in.  With it, Ansi-escape sequences
												  will have their colorizing effects but will themselves be concealed (again, when AnsiEsc is enabled and
												  one has used set conceallevel=[2 or 3]).
												  Also available at vim.sf.net
												  where you may rank it.


     AsNeeded  <!-- {{{2 -->
         Updated Feb 25, 2013 (v17l)          <!-- vbafiles/AsNeeded.vba.gz -->
		 Manual
                                                  Supports automatic sourcing (loading) of functions as needed.  AsNeeded.vim is a plugin
                                                  that sources other scripts in the .vim/AsNeeded directory when a function is called
                                                  that is needed.  One may use :AsNeeded command or :AN command.  AsNeeded actually
                                                  supports as-needed sourcing for functions, maps, and commands.


     AutoAlign suite  <!-- {{{2 -->
         Updated Mar 18, 2013 (v14k)          <!-- vbafiles/AutoAlign.vba.gz -->
		 Manual
                                                  Uses the Align.vba.gz
                                                  package to facilitate aligning equations, etc, as you type them.
                                                  Also available at vim.sf.net
                                                  where you may rank it.


     Blockhl: Nesting Level Based Highlighting For C <!-- {{{2 -->
         Updated Sep 22, 2011 (v6e) <!-- vbafiles/blockhl.vba.gz -->
		 Manual
		                                          Blockhl controls the highlighting of leading tabs based on the nesting level of {}s
												  for the C and C++ languages by providing a sequence of graylevels.
												  The file should be put into the .../after/syntax/c directory.


     Calendar Utilities  <!-- {{{2 -->
         Updated Oct 08, 2008 (v3b)           <!-- vbafiles/calutil.vba.gz -->
		 Manual
                                                 Used by visincr.vim (which is described
                                                 below), <calutil.vim> provides three calendar-related functions:
                                                 DayOfWeek(y,m,d), Cal2Jul(y,m,d), and Jul2Cal(julday).  DayOfWeek() converts a date
                                                 to a day of week name, and the other two convert between dates and the Julian day.


     Cecmatrix: Matrix Handling <!-- {{{2 -->
         Updated Mar 18, 2013 (v1d)           <!-- vbafiles/cecmatrix.vba.gz -->
		 Manual
		                                          Using this plugin is a snap!  Just...
												
												        Visual-block select a region of text containing a matrix of numbers, and type  :MatSet MatrixName  (ex. :MatSet A)
												        :Mat matrix-expression (for example, :Mat D=(A+B)/C, or :Mat 1/E)
												        :MatWrite matrix-expression  (ex. :MatWrite D  which will write the D matrix after the current line in the text)
												
												  Uses the Align and cecutil plugins; Align isn't strictly necessary, although cecmatrix will produce
												  nicer output with it; cecutil is provided along with cecmatrix.


     Cscope Interface <!-- {{{2 -->
         Updated Apr 27, 2012 (v5h)           <!-- vbafiles/cecscope.vba.gz -->
		 Manual
                                                 (vim v7.0 only) Cscope interface to find functions which call functions,
                                                 are called by functions, etc.  Put in your .vim/plugin directory, and
                                                 try :CSh for help.  There's optional local quickfix windows, vertical
                                                 or horizontal window with cscope output, menus, etc.


     DrC's Utilities contains various functions and some maps:  <!-- {{{2 -->
         Updated Apr 03, 2010 (v18h)          <!-- vbafiles/cecutil.vba.gz -->
		 Manual
                                                 Marks: SaveMark(markname) RestoreMark(markname) DestroyMark(markname)
                                                 Pos'n: SaveWinPosn() RestoreWinPosn() \swp \rwp  (actually uses <Leader>)


     C Function Menu Generator <!-- {{{2 -->
                                                 Marcel van der Laan wrote a function
                                                 :call C_ListFuncs() which uses flist to generate a menu of functions in the current file.


     C Compiler Commands <!-- {{{2 -->
         Updated Jan 05, 2006 (v1)            <!-- vbafiles/compiling.vba.gz -->
		 Manual
                                                The compiling.vim plugin
                                                provides error format files for several C compilers, plus
                                                a :Chk command to show one window with source with lines with errors and warnings
                                                given Error highlighting and a quickfix window showing the associated messages.


     CtagExpl: Ctags Explorer <!-- {{{2 -->
         Updated Feb 22, 2011 (v1k)           <!-- vbafiles/CtagExpl.vba.gz -->
		 Manual
		                                          An explorer for tags files generated by exuberant ctags; much like
												  Lakshmanan's taglist explorer.  However,
												  CtagExpl cooperates with gdbmgr, providing it with a tags-based explorer.


     CVS Conflict File Handler <!-- {{{2 -->
         Updated Sep 27, 2011 (v2h)           <!-- vbafiles/CVSconflict.vba.gz -->
		 Manual
                                                 When one does "cvs update", one may get files marked with "C" for
                                                 conflict.  Cvs was unable to automatically merge one's local
                                                 version with the repository, and merging requires human intervention.
                                                 The :CVSconflict command takes the current conflict file,
                                                 splits it into two separate files, and enables vimdiff-style
                                                 editing and viewing.


     Decho: DrC's Vim Debugger  <!-- {{{2 -->
         Updated May 07, 2013 (v21o)          <!-- vbafiles/Decho.vba.gz -->

												 The Decho.vim plugin provides debugging messages in a separate window.
												 One puts
												 Decho "some message here"
												 -or-
												 call Decho("another message")
												 and Decho will split the screen with a five line debugging window on the
												 bottom of the display where the messages will appear.  Allows one to
												 inspect multiple error messages with the usual vim editing commands!
												
												 Decho can optionally redirect its messages to a separate dedicated tab,
												 to Vim's messages list, or to a "remote" vim.
												
												 More help and commands are available - see their descriptions Decho's manual.

		 Manual
                                                 A plugin for drawing vertical, horizontal, and slanted lines using text.
												 With DrawIt, one may use the number pad to leave a trail of dashes,
                                                 bars, etc behind.  Furthermore, it also supports using visual-block specified regions
                                                 to draw boxes, ellipses, arrowheads, lines, and to specify floods.
												
												 New: DrawIt has two new commands, :DIsngl and :DIdbl, that tell DrawIt to draw boxes using
												 utf-8 box characters (single-bar, double-bar).  Your current file needs to be using the
												 utf-8 encoding for this to work.

     Gdbgmgr: Gnu Debugger Manager for Vim<!-- {{{2 -->
         Updated Mar 18, 2013 (v2b)           <!-- tarfiles/gdbmgr.tar.gz -->
		 Manual
		 Requirements: linux and a "huge" vim
		 Gdbmgr has two main components: a plugin portion, which provides an interface for the user, and the second component, written in C, which provides communications between vim and gdb.
		 Gdbmgr works with core dumps, utilizes hovering-cursor balloons to reveal variables' values, and provides a runtime interface to your program via gdb and vim.
		 It doesn't touch vim's source code (no patches!) or need external interpreters, unlike several other ways to get vim and gdb to work together.
		 											
														 GdbMgr provides an interface between vim and gdb: no patches!
														 No external interpreters are used (ie. no perl, no python, no ruby, ...)
														 GdbMgr requires a "huge" vim (configure --with-features=huge) with one or more of the following choices:
														
															    configure: --enable-perlinterp
														        configure: --enable-pythoninterp
															    have in Makefile: EXTRA_LIBS=-lutil
															
														 Integrated multi-window displays available include: Assembly, Breakpoints, Expressions, Function Stack, Messages, Source, Threads, and Watchpoints; it also supports
														     in an integrated fashion "foreign apps": Netrw, CtagExpl, HdrTag,
															 and bufexplorer (thanks go to Jeff Lanzarotta for the last!).
														

													     Customizable display (one may pick any subset of the integrated windows available and specify how they're to be displayed and/or stacked).
														 Snapshot 1
														     This snapshot shows GdbMgr with a breakpoint and a temporary breakpoint in prog7's Func2() function.
														

														 Snapshot 2
														     This snapshot shows GdbMgr with the Command window having had a dialog with the user (ie. "Enter something:", user entered "OK<cr>", etc.
															 The program has run to completion.
														

														 Its distributed as a gzipped tarball instead of the vimball format usually used here as it contains some binaries (the two xpm files for the breakpoint signs)
														 Currently tested only under Linux; it definitely does need a Unix-like environment. I need a mac person to tell me how to get a shared library working on the
														     Mac.  I've included a first cut at it with Makefile.mac (under .vim/gdbmgr/src)
														 Integration with vim and gdb is provided by the plugin itself via vim's libcall() function and a small shared library written in C (code provided)
														 At the current time, gdbmgr has moved from alpha to beta (ie. majoring in bug removal, minoring in new features; its been working well lately).
														     Please let me know if you experience problems (my email address is at the top of gdbmgr.vim).
														

														


     GetScript<!-- {{{2 -->

                                                  express an interest in by putting a line into the GetScript/GetScript.dat
                                                  file.  With cooperating plugins, GetScript can build the data file itself, too.
												  Unfortunately, there was a bug that makes the getscript.vim version that was distributed with vim v7.0
												  cause difficulties with a vimball-installation of a new getscript.vim.  So, you'll need to remove
												  the older version of getscript.vim:

                                                    Change directory to the directory holding the vim 7.0 distribution's plugin/ and autoload/ directories.

     HiLinkTrace <!-- {{{2 -->
         Updated Apr 03, 2013 (v4l)           <!-- vbafiles/hilinks.vba.gz -->
		 Manual
                                                  A plugin which traces the highlighting linkages; ie. just what highlighting
                                                  groups associated with the word under the cursor? (hilinks.vim, implements a map "\hlt")


     Highlighting Matching Brackets  <!-- {{{2 -->
         Updated Feb 22, 2011 (v23k)           <!-- vbafiles/HiMtchBrkt.vba.gz -->
		 Manual
                                                  A Vim 6.0 plugin that highlights a matching bracket when the cursor moves on it: (){}[]  (actually the |'matchpairs'| option is used).
												
                                                  The matching bracket is highlighted when the cursor is moved on top of the bracket.
												  It does so by making a fair number of maps that intercept the requested motion, perform the requested motion,
												  then also call the HiMatchBracket() function which does the work to highlight any matching bracket.
												  Basically it does a "%" to find the matching bracket (if any) and then constructs and executes an appropriate ":match" command.
												
                                                  Version 12 supports overloading of 0, too (if you have vim6.2 and patch 405 or later).

                                                  Because vim is rich with commands that can move the cursor, the script also uses the CursorHold event
												  (see help for cursorhold and updatetime) to highlight matching brackets after the cursor is left still for awhile.

     Network Oriented Reading, Writing, and Browsing  <!-- {{{2 -->
         Updated Jun 05, 2013 (v150a)           <!-- vbafiles/netrw.vba.gz -->
		 Manual
                                                  Supports network-oriented editing with urls.  One may read and write files
                                                  using one of several supported protocols (ex: ftp, scp) and browse
                                                  directories, both remotely and locally.  This version requires vim 7.0.
												  Be sure to remove any older versions of netrw before attempting to install this version.

												  In version v142b of netrw, g:netrw_winsize's meaning has been changed.  Previously, it was the number of
												  rows or lines to be used for new windows spawned off of netrw (ex. when using v or o).  The new
												  method uses g:netrw_winsize as a percentage of the netrw's window size in the appropriate direction
												  (ie. winheight or winwidth).  The percentage is an integer (by default, it is 50).

												  Unfortunately, there was a bug that makes the netrw version that was distributed with vim v7.0
												  cause difficulties with a vimball-installation of a new netrw.  So, for vim v7.0, you'll need to remove
												  the older version of netrw:

                                                    Change directory to the directory holding the vim 7.0 distribution's plugin/ and autoload/ directories.
                                                    /bin/rm plugin/netrw*.vim autoload/netrw*.vim doc/pi_netrw.txt


												  Beginning with v108b of netrw: sourcing remote files is supported.

												  Here's a list of some netrw options that I myself use:
												
													let g:netrw_altv          = 1
													let g:netrw_fastbrowse    = 2
													let g:netrw_keepdir       = 0
													let g:netrw_liststyle     = 2
													let g:netrw_retmap        = 1
													let g:netrw_silent        = 1

												 will be cleaned.  With :NetrwClean!, this plugin will attempt to remove netrw from both your personal directory
												 and the system directory.  You need permission to remove such files, of course.  This plugin may be helpful
												 for those who've previously gotten an up-to-date version of netrw but then update their vim later via ftp, cvs, etc
												 with an even more recent version of netrw (in that case, use :NetrwClean).

     Rainbow  <!-- {{{2 -->
         Updated Oct 19, 2012 (v2q)           <!-- vbafiles/Rainbow.vba.gz -->
		 Manual
                                                  C and C++: this plugin provides a rainbow of colors for matching brackets ( [] () {} ) depending
                                                  on their nesting level.  One may choose any subset of these brackets for highlighting.
												  Lisp: The syntax file distributed with Vim for Lisp already supports rainbow highlighting of ()s; bring up vim and
												  type ":help ft-lisp-syntax".
												  Matlab: this plugin provides rainbow highlighting for if for switch while,
												  again, depending on their nesting level.  One may choose any subset of these regions for highlighting, too.
												  LaTeX: this plugin provides rainbow highlighting depending on brace depth "{}()[]", begin-end depth, and dollar depth.
												  This mode is somewhat ugly, but I've found it very useful for finding problems in LaTeX scripts.

                                                  Multiple runs of the filter are clearly separated in the filter output window.

     Tar Handler <!-- {{{2 -->
         Updated Apr 17, 2013 (v29)           <!-- vbafiles/tar.vba.gz -->
		 Manual
                                                  Michael Toren wrote a nice plugin to handle tar files.
                                                  I've written a related one that also handles writing changed files back into the tarball.

												  Unfortunately, there was a bug that makes the zip.vim version that was distributed with vim v7.0
												  cause difficulties with a vimball-installation of a new zip.vim.  So, you'll need to remove
												  the older version of zip.vim:

                                                    Change directory to the directory holding the vim 7.0 distribution's plugin/ and autoload/ directories.

     Vim Error Finder <!-- {{{2 -->
         Updated Apr 17, 2012 (v2i)           <!-- vbafiles/VimErrFind.vba.gz -->
                                                  When vim gives an error message while running a plugin, it gives a function name and a line number
												  which is relative to the function's beginning.  This plugin provides ":VEF funcname rel_line_num",
												  which preferentially jumps to the function in the current buffer (but will use tags to find the
												  function's source file otherwise).


     Vimball Archiver<!-- {{{2 -->
         Updated Apr 17, 2013 (v36)           <!-- tarfiles/vimball.tar.gz -->
		 Manual
                                                  Archive and de-archive vim plugins.  To install:
												  well, I've decided that the vimball plugin itself should not expect that vimball is available to extract itself.
                                                  Hence, it is now being distributed as vimball.tar.gz.  To unravel and install it:

                                                   Change directory to the directory holding the plugin/ and autoload/ directories where you want to install vimball.
                                                       It is probably best to install the new vimball in the distribution directory. If you choose not to overwrite the
													   version that came with the plugin, but to put the new vimball in your personal directories, you must remove or otherwise
													   deactivate the original version that came with vim 7.0.
                                                   gunzip vimball.tar.gz
												   tar -oxvf vimball.tar
                                                   (unix) chmod a+r autoload/vimball.vim doc/pi_vimball.txt plugin/vimballPlugin.vim

												 If you'd like to use a C program (you'll need a C compiler) that will create vimballs: mkvimball.
												 For beginners, may I suggest:
												
												   You should have a .vim/ or vimfiles\ in your home directory.  Bring up vim, then type  :echo &rtp.  The first directory on that
												       comma separated list is where vim expects to find your .vim/ (or vimfiles\) directory.
												   You should have, as a minimum, the following two lines in your <.vimrc> to enable plugins:
												
set nocp
filetype plugin on

                                                   I often use it to target substitutes onto just a visual-block selection.
                                                   The original <vis.vim> was by Stefan Roemer, but this one
                                                   has been radically modified to support embedded tabs.  It appears to operate
                                                   considerably faster, and has no side effects on register usage, etc.
                                                   It requires DrC's Utilities as it
                                                   also retains the original cursor/window positioning using functions from
                                                   that package.

                                                 tabs, handles ragged right visual blocks, will insert spaces as needed if
                                                 the count's string-length exceeds the visual-block's constraints, and also
                                                 accepts an optional incrementation argument (I [incr]) (which can be negative).
                                                 By default incr is 1.  If the initial number is zero-padded on the left (ie. 001),
                                                 then the column of numbers will also be zero-padded as needed.  For the maps
                                                 which handle dates, you'll also need to have
                                                 calutil.vba.gz.

                                                    I [incr]  - create an ascending or descending column of numbers, right padded
                                                    II [incr [zfill]] - create an ascending or descending column of numbers, left padded
                                                    IA [incr]   - create an ascending or descending alphabetic column
                                                    ID [incr]   - create an ascending or descending column of daynames
                                                    IYMD [incr] - create an ascending or descending column of year/month/day dates
                                                    IMDY [incr] - create an ascending or descending column of month/day/year dates
                                                    IDMY [incr] - create an ascending or descending column of day/month/year dates

                                                 The :R... versions (:RI :RII :RIYMD etc) restrict the renumbering/relabelling to
                                                 those lines which have an appropriate pattern (numbers for :RI and :RII, daynames

     Visual Mode Based Swapping  <!-- {{{2 -->
         Updated Mar 18, 2013 (v4f)           <!-- vbafiles/visswap.vba.gz -->
		 Manual
                                                 Swap text using visual modes!

                                                    Select first region using a visual mode (V, v, or ctrl-v), then press <ctrl-y> ("yank").
                                                    Select second region using a visual mode (V, v, or ctrl-v), then press <ctrl-x> ("exchange").

                                                 HelpExtractor technology is used to automatically install help for vswap.
                                                 There's also a tip about more swapping at Tip#329

                                                 In addition, one may replace columns of text with a selection:

                                                    Select source region using visual-block (ctrl-v) selection plus motion.
                                                    Hit <escape>
                                                    Move cursor to where the upper left corner of the column replacement should be; hit \vr
                                                        (the backslash is actually <Leader>)

		 Manual
                                                 Ever wonder where a function, script, or command was defined, or where a setting
                                                 was last set?  WhereFrom helps answer the question.  :WhereFrom[!] {function|map|setting|command}
                                                 (or :WF[!] {function|map|setting|command} for a shorter command) will search the runtimepath
                                                 to determine where the item was defined.  The optional "!" will make WhereFrom
                                                 continue looking for more than one instance -- the last one found is likely to be
                                                 the one you have currently loaded.


     Window Kill Ring <!-- {{{2 -->
         Updated Oct 08, 2008 (v1c)           <!-- vbafiles/WinRing.vba.gz -->
		 Manual
                                                 Implements a "kill ring" for a vim window:  :[N]R[!] [files]

     Zip Handler <!-- {{{2 -->
         Updated Jun 10, 2013 (v27b)           <!-- vbafiles/zip.vba.gz -->
		 Manual
                                                 Zip Handler handles zip files; it resembles Tar Handler in look and feel.
                                                 It handles browsing, reading, and writing files.

												 Unfortunately, there was a bug that makes the zip.vim version that was distributed with vim v7.0
												 cause difficulties with a vimball-installation of a new zip.vim.  So, you'll need to remove
												 the older version of zip.vim:

                                                   Change directory to the directory holding the vim 7.0 distribution's plugin/ and autoload/ directories.
                                                   /bin/rm plugin/zip*.vim autoload/zip*.vim doc/pi_zip.txt

                                                  (by Ron Aaron and C Campbell), similar to what the editor Brief provided.  Version 14 was both
                                                  about 2/3 the size and faster, and the latest handles quickfix windows, too.
