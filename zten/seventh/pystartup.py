# Add auto-completion and a stored history file of commands to your Python
# interactive interpreter. Requires Python 2.0+, readline. Autocomplete is
# bound to the Esc key by default (you can change it - see readline docs).
#
# Store the file in ~/.pystartup, and set an environment variable to point
# to it:  "export PYTHONSTARTUP=~/.pystartup" in bash.

# This binds the Tab key to the completion function, so hitting the Tab key
# twice suggests completions; it looks at Python statement names, the current
# local variables, and the available module names. For dotted expressions such
# as string.a, it will evaluate the expression up to the final '.' and then
# suggest completions from the attributes of the resulting object. Note that
# this may execute application-defined code if an object with a __getattr__()
# method is part of the expression.
